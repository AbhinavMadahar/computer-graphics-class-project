# Project Milestone Write-up

**CS 428 Spring 2021**

## Goals
In our program, the user creates a monster using different body parts.
At the beginning of the project, we wanted to encourage creativity.
We also wanted to make it simple enough for a child to use.

## What we have achieved so far
Our project demonstrably encourages creativity.
We have different body parts which can be modified, such as by changing their size.
We also included an undo button, so the user is more comfortable taking risks and trying more unusual monster configurations.

We also find that this is easy enough for a child to use.
The UI is standard; there is a display area and some tools on the side, like in other programs and games.
The body parts are selected from a drop-down menu, and the attributes are changed using input fields next to the body part selector.

You can watch a demo of the program in the file named `milestone-demo.mp4`.

## Moving Forwards

So far, we have written our code using plain WebGL.
We will now replace this code with code that uses Three.js, a popular library for making interactive displays and games with WebGL.
It lets us create interesting graphics quickly, and it has excellent support for three-dimensional graphics.
