# Monster Creator

**CS 428 Spring 2021**

**Elizaveta Belaya and Abhinav Madahar**

This program lets the user design a monster, like in a video game.
The source code is in the `src` directory.
We use GNU Make to build the program, and the built files are in `dest`.
To use this project, run `make` and then open `dest/index.html`.
Make sure your browser supports WebGL 2.0; Safari does not yet support this, but Chrome and Firefox do.
The `vendor` directory just contains some libraries we use.

To view the write-ups for the class, please open the `writeups` directory.
